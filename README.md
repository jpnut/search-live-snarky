# Searchable Live Snarky

This is the repository for [searchlivesnarky.com](https://searchlivesnarky.com), a fan run project to make it easier to search and filter through the large catalogue of Snarky Puppy live shows. This is an open source project, and contributions either to the library of shows, or to the functionality of the site are more than welcome! The project is written in Typescript, using React, with hosting provided by Netlify.

## Contributing

If you would like to add new shows, or find an error/missing data in existing shows, the easiest way to contribute is by creating an issue with the relevant information.

If you would like to make material changes to the functionality of the site, simply fork this repository, make any changes, and submit a PR.

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
