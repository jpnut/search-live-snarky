The crowd nails 3 over 4 clapping patterns under a pizz solo from Zach. He moves to the bow and stretches. Beep Box is all Bobby. He alternates between Moog and organ over the outro (sometimes both at once), takes it on his own for a bit, then the band comes in hard. My favorite part of the whole night. Nate weaves a thread into Tio Macaco. He and Larnell bring some new calls in just before the finale. Big Ugly finds its way back in for the first time in a while. Bullock takes the first solo left. Bob takes two on guitar and freaks things out with delays to close out the set. What About Me? gets a throwback from Justin, as he pushes the band into a tune from the early days of the band, Intelligent Design.

Grown Folks goes straight church with Bobby on organ. Bob takes the last solo on guitar. Justin takes a Rhodes solo on Semente, which Larnell and Nate gently ease into Binky. The tune starts, and stays, dark. Bullock takes a screaming, minimalist solo on effected tenor. Maz and Larnell get into some rhythmic interplay during a flugel horn solo. Lots of (milked) Rhodes and bass conversation before the outro. The band moves quickly into the longest version of Tarova we've ever played. Zach takes a solo on violin (though it doesn't sound like it) and the band eventually breaks down to just him and Bobby, who goes P-Funk on Minimoog bass. Everyone joins the trance one by one until it launches back into the tune. Nate takes a percussion solo amidst “Tutu” quotes. Gemini cools things off for a bit before Bobby solos on Minimoog. What About Me? gets a seriously aggressive treatment from Bob and Larnell. Bobby takes things home on the encore with Sleeper.

A beautiful sounding room with a lively crowd.","artists":{"Chris Bullock":"tenor sax","Bob Reynolds":"tenor sax","Mike “Maz” Maher":"trumpet and flugelhorn","Justin Stanton":"trumpet and keyboards","Bill Laurance":"keyboards","Chris McQueen":"guitar","Michael League":"bass","Larnell Lewis":"drums","Marcelo Woloski":"percussion"},"sound_crew":{"Mike Harrison":"sound (front of house)","Matt Recchia":"sound (monitors)","Nic Hard":"engineering and mixing"},"tags":{"tracks":{"Beep Box":true,"Big Ugly":true,"Binky":true,"Palermo":true,"Semente":true,"Shofukan":true,"Tarova":true,"Whitecap":true,"Young Stuff":true},"artists":{"Bill Laurance":true,"Bob Reynolds":true,"Chris Bullock":true,"Chris McQueen":true,"Justin Stanton":true,"Larnell Lewis":true,"Marcelo Woloski":true,"Michael League":true,"Mike “Maz” Maher":true}}},{"name":"MAY 02, 2017 - GLASGOW, UNITED KINGDOM","flac":"https://store.snarkypuppy.com/collections/live-shows-flac/products/may-2-2017-glasgow-united-kingdom-flac","mp3":"https://store.snarkypuppy.com/collections/live-shows-mp3/products/may-2-2017-glasgow-united-kingdom-mp3","location":"02 ABC, Glasgow, United Kingdom","date":"May 2, 2017","setlist":["Outlier","Big Ugly","Ready Wednesday"],"encore":["What About Me?"],"track_info":"First night doing the multi-track recording. We had digital distortion for the first half of the set, so only the last four songs are available. Bob Reynolds rips through Outlier. Bullock takes a distorted tenor solo on Big Ugly before McQueen and Larnell duke it out over the outro. The crowd won't let the last melodic phrase go, so Bill uses it to transition into Ready Wednesday. Maz goes late Miles on the solo section to What About Me? and Larnell absolutely trashes the drum solo to close it out. Lots of fire in this set.","artists":{"Chris Bullock":"tenor sax","Bob Reynolds":"tenor sax","Mike “Maz” Maher":"trumpet and flugelhorn","Justin Stanton":"trumpet and keyboards","Bill Laurance":"keyboards","Chris McQueen":"guitar","Michael League":"bass","Larnell Lewis":"drums","Marcelo Woloski":"percussion"},"sound_crew":{"Mike Harrison":"sound (front of house)","Matt Recchia":"sound (monitors)","Nic Hard":"engineering and mixing"},"tags":{"tracks":{"Big Ugly":true,"Outlier":true,"Ready Wednesday":true,"What About Me?":true},"artists":{"Bill Laurance":true,"Bob Reynolds":true,"Chris Bullock":true,"Chris McQueen":true,"Justin Stanton":true,"Larnell Lewis":true,"Marcelo Woloski":true,"Michael League":true,"Mike “Maz” Maher":true}}},{"name":"APRIL 30, 2017 - CHELTENHAM, UNITED KINGDOM","flac":"https://store.snarkypuppy.com/collections/live-shows/products/april-30-2017-cheltenham-united-kingdom-flac","mp3":"https://store.snarkypuppy.com/collections/live-shows/products/april-30-2017-cheltenham-united-kingdom-mp3","location":"Town Hall, Cheltenham, United Kingdom","date":"April 30, 2017","setlist":["Kite","Grown Folks","Semente","Beep Box","Palermo","Tarova","Big Ugly","What About Me?"],"encore":["Lingus*"],"track_info":"Our first recorded night of the tour! Tenor sax is king this evening. Kite opens the set with solos from Maz on flugelhorn and Bill on Fender Rhodes. Grown Folks has solos from Justin on trumpet, Bullock on a particularly raunchy effected tenor sax, and McQueen on a Hendrixian guitar solo to close it out. Bob takes a tenor solo on Semente, which blends into Beep Box, capped of with a muted trumpet solo by Maz. The band sits in Palermo longer than usual as McQueen, Bill, and Justin get into some crazy rhythmic accompaniment during Bullock's solo. Marcelo gets playful on top of the crowd's clapping rhythm during the outro. Tarova is brighter than normal and full of energy. Bill gets weird on Moog. Big Ugly makes its English debut. Maz takes a wah-wah trumpet solo and McQueen takes it home on guitar. Bob takes the open section on What About Me? before Larnell closes it out. The encore features the unbelievable Chris Potter ripping a hole in Lingus. Despite an acoustically challenging room, nice energy and vibe from both the band and the audience throughout.","artists":{"Chris Bullock":"tenor sax","Bob Reynolds":"tenor sax","Mike “Maz” Maher":"trumpet and flugelhorn","Justin Stanton":"trumpet and keyboards","Bill Laurance":"keyboards","Chris McQueen":"guitar","Michael League":"bass","Larnell Lewis":"drums","Marcelo Woloski":"percussion"},"other_artists":{"*":{"Chris Potter":"tenor sax"}},"sound_crew":{"Mike Harrison":"sound (front of house)","Matt Recchia":"sound (monitors)","Nic Hard":"engineering and mixing"},"tags":{"tracks":{"Beep Box":true,"Big Ugly":true,"Grown Folks":true,"Kite":true,"Lingus":true,"Palermo":true,"Semente":true,"Tarova":true,"What About Me?":true},"artists":{"Bill Laurance":true,"Bob Reynolds":true,"Chris Bullock":true,"Chris McQueen":true,"Chris Potter":true,"Justin Stanton":true,"Larnell Lewis":true,"Marcelo Woloski":true,"Michael League":true,"Mike “Maz” Maher":true}}},{"name":"APRIL 29, 2017 - DUBLIN, IRELAND","flac":"https://store.snarkypuppy.com/collections/live-shows-flac/products/april-29-2017-dublin-ireland-flac","mp3":"https://store.snarkypuppy.com/collections/live-shows-mp3/products/april-29-2017-dublin-ireland-mp3","location":"Town Hall, Cheltenham, United Kingdom","date":"April 29, 2017","setlist":["Flood","Whitecap","Semente","Palermo","Grown Folks","Ready Wednesday"],"encore":["Be My Husband*"],"track_info":"A last-minute show in the cozy Sugar Club added after Vicar Street sold out. Board mix with room mics (before our recording rig came in), but the sound is good. The band really stretches each tune. Larnell opens with a lyrical, poly-rhythmic drum intro to Flood. Justin takes the first solo on Moog. ML intros Whitecap with mod-delay harmonics. It's Bill's first day with the clavinet and he takes it advantage of it while Maz solos on flugelhorn. Semente gets a Fender Rhodes solo from Bill. Bullock takes a tenor solo on an extended version of Palermo. Grown Folks is funky. Bass solo and lots of rhythmic interaction with drums and percussion before McQueen takes it out on guitar. Marcelo takes a pandeiro intro on Tio Macaco and duets with Larnell to close it. Bill brings Ready Wednesday in with an ostinato. Justin solos on Prophet. Lucy Woodward joins for the encore of Nina Simone's Be My Husband. Maz trades his trumpet in for a vocal mic. Fun, elastic gig in a small room.","artists":{"Chris Bullock":"tenor sax","Bob Reynolds":"tenor sax","Mike “Maz” Maher":"trumpet, flugelhorn and vocals","Justin Stanton":"trumpet and keyboards","Bill Laurance":"keyboards","Chris McQueen":"guitar","Michael League":"bass","Larnell Lewis":"drums","Marcelo Woloski":"percussion"},"other_artists":{"*":{"Lucy Woodward":"vocals"}},"sound_crew":{"Mike Harrison":"sound (front of house)","Matt Recchia":"sound (monitors)","Nic Hard":"engineering and mixing"},"tags":{"tracks":{"Be My Husband":true,"Flood":true,"Grown Folks":true,"Palermo":true,"Ready Wednesday":true,"Semente":true,"Whitecap":true},"artists":{"Bill Laurance":true,"Bob Reynolds":true,"Chris Bullock":true,"Chris McQueen":true,"Justin Stanton":true,"Larnell Lewis":true,"Lucy Woodward":true,"Marcelo Woloski":true,"Michael League":true,"Mike “Maz” Maher":true}}}]
